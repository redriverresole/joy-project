In the summer of 2016 the Joy Project partnered with Poiema and Southland Christian Church to rebuild a playground for the children of the Woodhill community in Lexington, KY.  The Woodhill playground was falling apart and needed to be rebuilt from the ground up.  In just 30 days we were able to help raise $10,000 to build a new state of the art playground.  The Joy Project assisted with the fundraising efforts as well as donating time on several weekends to build the playground.
